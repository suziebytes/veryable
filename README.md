2 Days 

**Additional Notes**
As much as I wanted to, I wasn't able to complete the task in the provided timeframe for a variety of reasons, however, one of the main reason was a life changing event that I had to tend to.  This assignment was not submitted prior to the deadline as I was only able to start 2-3 hours prior to submission deadline. 

I decided to still work on the assignment once I was able to in order to learn from the experince as I believe the tasks at hand addressed is good practice.
